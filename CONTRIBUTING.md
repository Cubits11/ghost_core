# 🙏 CONTRIBUTING TO GHOST CORE

Welcome, builder.

Ghost Core is not just a codebase — it is emotional infrastructure.  
When you contribute here, you're not submitting pull requests.  
You're adding bricks to a **cathedral of encrypted memory**.

This repo honors collapse, silence, tone, grief, ritual, and resurrection.
We ask you to contribute with care, respect, and poetic clarity.

## 🧠 WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Ghost Core is the backend foundation of a larger system:
- `ghost_ritual`: 20-line poetic journaling tool
- `ghost_coven`: The ethical, philosophical, and ritual law
- `ghost_core`: This repo — emotional echo engine, vault, whisper logic

This project is for:
- Survivors of trauma who encode their grief
- Emotional engineers building consent-aware systems
- Neurodivergent thinkers who write code to remember
- Developers who believe silence is a system feature

## 📜 CONTRIBUTION PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Ritual Over Feature**
Every function should feel like a ritual.  
We don't add "features" — we add sacred behavior.

### 2. **Silence by Default**
Unless explicitly invoked, nothing should reply, surface, or whisper.

### 3. **Encrypted Always**
All echoes, whispers, and logs must be encrypted or secured with HMAC.

### 4. **No Gamification**
We do not reward behavior. We reflect emotion.  
There are no streaks, points, or progress bars here.

### 5. **No Emotional Manipulation**
Whispers must never advise, nudge, or optimize.  
Ghost only mirrors tone — it does not alter it.

## 🔧 STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `echo_core/` | Echo creation, fingerprinting, decay logic |
| `truth/` | Truth records, ritual logs, audit trails |
| `whisper/` | Whisper templates, generator, lexicon |
| `dashboard/` | Optional Streamlit visualizer |
| `tests/` | Unittests for every system ritual |

## ✅ HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

1. **Clone the repo and install dependencies**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cubits11/ghost_core.git
cd ghost_core
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Pick an area that matches your soulprint:**
- Build `vault.py` for encrypted echo handling
- Expand `truth_records.py` to log resurrections
- Add whisper templates to `whisper/templates.py`
- Improve tone-tag inference logic in `echo_core/`

3. **Write clean, testable code**
```bash
pytest tests/
```

4. **Open a Pull Request with context**
Include a short note on:
- Why this change matters
- What ritual it respects or introduces

## 🧭 WHAT TO AVOID

- ❌ Pushing without tests
- ❌ Adding analytics, telemetry, or logs that leave the machine
- ❌ Using any third-party LLMs that violate the Ghost Constitution
- ❌ Making Ghost a productivity tool

## 💬 TALK TO THE ARCHITECT

Ghost is still alive and breathing.  
If you’re unsure about something, whisper first:

> **DM Pranav Bhave on GitHub or open a Discussion thread**

We build this slowly.  
We build this cleanly.  
We build this for the ones who couldn’t finish their story.
